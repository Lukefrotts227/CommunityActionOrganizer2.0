# CommunityActionOrganizer2.0
I am remaking my Community Organizer hackathon project. I will be using what I know now. Will be deploying. 

# Before
- I had aimed to build on my old project which used a fastapi, react and mongo stack 
- I am now switching up the stack so I will simply redo the project and reference my old code

# The stack
- I will be using Django 
- I will be using tailwindcss
- Will still use mongoDB as it offers flexability
