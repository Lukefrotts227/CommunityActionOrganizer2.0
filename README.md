# CommunityActionOrganizer2.0
I am remaking my Community Organizer hackathon project. I will be using what I know now. Will be deploying. 

# What is this project? 
At its heart this is a social media application designed for local communites. 

# Before
- I had aimed to build on my old project which used a fastapi, react and mongo stack 
- I am now switching up the stack so I will simply redo the project and reference my old code

# The stack
- I will be using Django 
- I will be using tailwindcss
- Switching over to SQL for now
- The basics of the stack will be Django, HTMX and Tailwind

# Why the new stack
- Django is a framework that would work well with this application and I was interested in trying it out 
- I felt a backend first approach would be best for this specifc app
- However I liked the features fo a big javascript framework like react
- Htmx gives me power on the frontend that basic html templates do not offer
- Tailwind is useful for styling quickly and effectivley 
- The transistion to SQL not only allows me to use the full features of Django but also is useful for a social media application
